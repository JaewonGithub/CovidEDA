# Background
The motivation to explore the dataset on COVID-19 is deeply rooted in the profound impact this global pandemic has had on all of us around the world, including myself. By immersing myself in the data and leveraging EDA techniques, I seek to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and correlations that can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the pandemic. These insights not only inform my own understanding but also empower me to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing discourse surrounding COVID-19. Ultimately, my goal is to use data-driven insights to inform others about the significance of COVID-19 and contribute to the collective effort of addressing the challenges posed by it on a global scale.

Data hails from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) - contains COVID-19 information from 2020-01-01 to 2021-04-30. 

### The Questions answered throughout this project using SQL queries:
1. What were the cumulative global counts for COVID-19 infections and deaths as of April 30, 2021? 

2. How did the monthly counts of COVID-19 infections and deaths vary over time specifically for the United States?

3. Which ten countries had the highest infection rates, and what were their corresponding death rates?

4. Which countries exhibited the highest infection rates within each continent?

5. What is the correlation between the infection rate and other relevant variables, such as GDP per capita , ages, and population density?

# Utilized Tools

 **Each query for this project aimed at drawing insights from COVID-19 data, here's the approach:**
<br>

## 1. Global significance of COVID-19
To determine the global infection count and death count of COVID-19 as of April 30th, 2021, the dataset was filtered to include only the last date available. Rows with missing location (country) were excluded from the analysis to ensure accurate and meaningful insights into the global situation of COVID-19. 

```sql
SELECT 
	SUM(total_cases) AS global_infection_count,
	SUM(total_deaths) AS global_death_count
FROM (
	SELECT *
	FROM covid_deaths
	WHERE date = '2021-04-30' AND continent IS NOT NULL AND location IS NOT NULL
);
```
| global_infection_count | global_death_count |
|------------------------|--------------------|
|       151,398,759      |       3,180,223    |

### Breakdown:
- **Total Infection** - The staggering global infection count underscores the profound impact of COVID-19 on a worldwide scale, highlighting its widespread reach and severity.

- **Total Death** - With a death count surpassing 3 million, COVID-19's impact extends significantly to the fatality aspect, emphasizing the profound toll the pandemic has taken on human lives globally.

## 2. Looking into United States 
To delve deeper into the first question, I have narrowed my focus to the United States, which is my primary area of interest. Additionally, I have generated monthly reports to enhance the informativeness of visualizations.
```sql
SELECT 
	date,
	total_cases AS infection_count, 
	COALESCE(total_deaths , 0) AS death_count
FROM covid_deaths
WHERE
	location = 'United States' AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM date) = '1';
```

### Breakdown:
- **Trend Analysis:** Observing the trend from the line chart, before July of 2020, the graph depicting infection counts shows a relatively flat slope, indicating a slower spread of COVID-19 during that period. However, starting from August 2020, there is a noticeable increase in the slope of curve, indicating a more rapid spread of the virus. This trend intensifies significantly from November 2020 to February 2021, where the infection count nearly triples within this period. The decreasing slope observed from February 2021 onward could potentially be attributed to the release and administration of better vaccinations and booster shots, which likely contributed to reducing the rate of new infections. 
<br></br>

![Image2](assets/Q2_image2.png)
### Breakdown:
- **Sudden Increase in April 2020:** The notable spike in infection counts observed in April 2020 may be attributed to the absence of widely available vaccinations for COVID-19 during that period. This lack of preventive measures likely contributed to the rapid spread of the virus within the population. Although the infection rate maintains a relatively consistent slope until November 2020, the death count experiences another sudden surge from that point onward. This could indicate exposure to new variants of COVID-19 for which the population was not adequately prepared, leading to increased fatalities.

- **High Correlation with Infection Count:** Analysis of the two graphs reveal a strong positive correlation between infection and death counts in the United States at various time points. The rate of increase in death counts mirrors the trend of infection count escalation, indicating a direct relationship between the spread of the virus and resultant fatalities. This correlation underscores the critical importance of controlling and mitigating the spread of COVID-19 infections to reduce associated mortality rates effectively.


## 3. Highest infection rate countries 
To identify the 10 countries with the highest infection rates and their corresponding death rates, following query was used to calculate the rates in percentage.
```sql
SELECT

	population,
	MAX(total_cases) AS total_cases, 
	ROUND(MAX((total_cases/population) * 100),3) AS infection_percent,
	MAX(total_deaths) AS total_deaths,
	ROUND(MAX(total_deaths)/MAX(total_cases) * 100 , 3) AS death_percent
FROM 
	covid_deaths
WHERE NOT
	(continent IS NULL OR
	 total_cases IS NULL OR 
	 total_deaths IS NULL OR
	 population IS NULL)
GROUP BY 
	location, population
ORDER BY

### Breakdown:
- **Country with the Greatest Infection Rate:** Surprisingly, Andorra, a European country known for its wealth, boasts the highest infection rate among the analyzed nations. This unexpected finding challenges common assumptions about wealth and healthcare infrastructure in relation to infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Lack of Correlation:** Analysis based on the histogram reveals a notable lack of correlation between infection rates and death rates in the countries. Despite having high infection rates, these countries exhibit varying death rates, indicating that the severity of COVID-19 outcomes may not be solely determined by the infection rate. This suggests that other factors such as healthcare capacity, treatment protocols, and demographics may significantly influence mortality rates.

- **High Death Rate Countries:** San Marino, United States, Slovenia, Czechia stand out for their unusually high death rates when infected with COVID-19, nearing 1.8%. This observation underscores the complexity of COVID-19 outcomes and highlights the importance of understanding and addressing factors contributing to higher mortality rates in specific regions or populations.

### Breakdown: 

- **Prevalency in Europe:** The unexpectedly large infection rate in Europe and the unexpectedly low infection rate in Africa highlight that the wealth of a country may not have a significant correlation with infection rates.

- **Insights on Oceania:** Oceania's low infection rate could be attributed to its relatively low total population. However, despite this, the death rate in Oceania does not significantly differ from other continents, indicating other potential factors at play.

- **Other potential factors:** The data suggests that there may be additional factors influencing infection and death rates beyond population and wealth, prompting the need to explore correlations with other factors.
